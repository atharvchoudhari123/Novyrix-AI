# LumaCore

LumaCore is a self-hosted AI platform.

It contains:

- LumaCore API
- LumaCore Engine
- Model registry
- Model runtime
- Training pipeline
- File handling
- Web interface
- Coding Playground
- Docker configuration

## LumaCore models

LumaCore 3.2  
LumaCore 4.0  
LumaCore 5.7

These are the LumaCore product tiers.

The actual model checkpoints are configured separately.

## Install

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate it:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Train all LumaCore model tiers

Run the unified training script:

```bash
chmod +x train_all.sh
./train_all.sh
```

The script trains the three LumaCore tiers separately:

```text
LumaCore 3.2
LumaCore 4.0
LumaCore 5.7
```

The resulting checkpoints are stored in:

```text
training/output/lumacore-3.2
training/output/lumacore-4.0
training/output/lumacore-5.7
```

The training script also creates the tier-specific training data and configuration it needs.


After training, make sure `.env` points each LumaCore tier to its corresponding checkpoint:

```env
LUMACORE_3_2_CHECKPOINT=./training/output/lumacore-3.2
LUMACORE_4_0_CHECKPOINT=./training/output/lumacore-4.0
LUMACORE_5_7_CHECKPOINT=./training/output/lumacore-5.7
```

## Start

Start the LumaCore API:

```bash
python3 apps/api/server.py
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Model tiers

### LumaCore 3.2

Designed as the faster, lightweight LumaCore tier.

### LumaCore 4.0

Designed as the balanced general-purpose LumaCore tier.

### LumaCore 5.7

Designed as the highest-capability LumaCore tier, with the largest practical model and most extensive training configuration.

## Capabilities

LumaCore is designed to support:

- Chat
- Multi-turn conversations
- Coding
- Debugging
- File analysis
- Website generation
- Plugin/tool integration
- Defensive security review
- Image generation
- Video generation
- Custom model training
- Multiple model tiers

## Important

The quality of each LumaCore model depends on:

- Base model
- Training data
- Training configuration
- Available compute
- Fine-tuning method
- Model size

Training the models does not automatically create a frontier-scale AI model. Larger and higher-quality datasets and appropriate compute are required to substantially improve model capabilities.
